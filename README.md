> A good excuse for those who need a break.

## What is that ?

This is a cli version of the [coffee-break](https://github.com/benavern/coffee-break) I made.

## Installation

```bash
npm i -g coffee-break-cli
```

## Usage

```
coffee-break
```

And just answere the questions.

You'll be able to set your own texts and duration. Then the app shows a progressbar, and you can go for your coffee break without worrying about having an excuse.
